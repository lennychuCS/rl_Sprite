# RLSprite
A basic bot for Rocket Leauge Coded by Lennychu in 3 weeks for RLBot Championship 2024.

## Current Status
Very early in design, work started on July 30th, 2024.

## Project Goals

### Easily beat my first attempt at a RLBot: Khris
Simple, create something better than my first RLBot. This bot was pretty bad, and should be easy to beat.

### Beat my fathers better implementation: Zanorb
This bot preformed considerably better than mine, and implemented a state machine and basic attacking and defensive stratagies.

### Enter into the RLBot Championship 2024.
My end goal is to design a bot that is able to be entered into the RLBot Championship 2024. The main hurdle here is creating a bot that can work iin 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3, as well as being able to beat a Pysonix Pro bot in a 2v2 match.
